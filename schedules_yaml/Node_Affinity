Node Affinity: Node affinity is conceptually similar to nodeSelector, allowing you to constrain which nodes your Pod can be scheduled on based on node labels.
There are two types of node affinity:

a.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. This functions like nodeSelector, but with a more expressive syntax.
pods are scheduled only on nodes matching specific labels, but does not remove them if the labels change.

b.preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the scheduler still schedules the Pod any other node.
Prefers nodes with specific labels but can schedule pods on any available nodes if necessary.
